                    sounds. It has a tiny body covered with smooth
                    fur and it has a furry tail as well. Cats have

                    Most cats are playful animals and enjoy
                    socialising with people. Cats like to play 
                    with toys and those that do not go outside 
                    often play at hunting indoors. Some cats, 
                    especially those that live outdoors, may be 
                    less sociable with people and other animals.
                    Cats sleep for many hours each day.

    A hobby is something that you love to get involve
    with, in your pass time or in leisure. It is the
    first thing that comes to your mind when you get
    bored. I also have a hobby that I like to get 
    involved in whenever I have time - Reading. <br>
    I read whenever I have free time. I read many kinds     
    of book such as history books, science books, 
    sometimes, it is novel and popular magazines. 
    Reading has a lot of advantages. First, reading
    is a cheap way to get information and entertainment.

    <p>
        Chess is definitely one of the most challenging
        and intellectually stimulating hobbies out
        there. Life is nothing but a great game of 
        chess, and every person we encounter is a piece
        on the board.

<p style="color: gold;">
    In addition to these practical benefits, sports as 
    a hobby can be a sanctuary, a space of solace, and 
    an escape from the relentless demands of work and 
    life. It's an opportunity to clear the mind, to 
    release stress, and to rejuvenate the spirit.

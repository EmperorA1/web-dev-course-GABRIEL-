            Dogs have a sense of time. It's 
            been proven that they know the difference

 future events, such as regular walk times.

            A study was conducted on dogs being
             away from their owners for varying hours and the studies show that dogs

who were away from their owners 
the longest showed the greatest amount of affection!
